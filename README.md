# Notes
This is a public repository of my LaTex notes, cheatsheets and other useful documents I created while learning. Much of this was created during my pursuit of [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, but I may add a few from my independent learning efforts. 

Currently, the repository hosts my notes for CS7210- Distributed Computing for OMSCS Georgia Tech. 
It also hosts my hand-written notes and a few other resources I created for CS6260- Applied Cryptography.

My hand-written notes are written on Rocketbook and converted to pdf. This leads to a few readability issues:
1) Some pages may be less readable than others (it is _hand_-written after all!) 
2) Sometimes the words written in lighter colors don't appear clearly on the scans. 

Despite these, I hope that some of it will be useful to other students, so I am putting them up anyway.
To improve readability, I am in the process of converting my hand-written notes for some courses to LaTex, and I shall upload them as I finish them. 

**Important Disclaimer**: These notes are by no means, "**official**" in any sense. They were also made by me _while_ I was a student, so there may be some minor errors. If you do find any errors, please file an issue on this repo with the document name and page number where issue was found. If the issue is factual/conceptual, a brief description of my error would be much appreciated.

In any case, thanks for dropping by! Good luck! ðŸ™‚
